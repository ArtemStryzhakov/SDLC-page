  <button class="accordion">Waterfall</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The waterfall model is one of the best known and oldest software development methods, named after the analogy of successive waterfalls - water falls from one level to the next and does not return..</p>
  
  <h4>Advantages:</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>This model is used only when the requirements are very well known, clear and fixed.</li>
      <li>Product definition is stable.</li>
      <li>Technology is understood.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>There are no ambiguous requirements.</li>
      <li>Ample resources with required expertise are available freely.</li>
      <li>The project is short.</li>
  </ul>

<button class="accordion">Iterative</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Pildiotsingu Iterative programming tulemus
    In programming specifically, iterative refers to a sequence of instructions or code being repeated until a specific end result is achieved. ... Almost all computer programs are executed by using iterations and loops to execute specific tasks and provide solutions to problems.</p>
    
    <h4>Advantages:</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Some working functionality can be developed and early in the software development life cycle (SDLC).</li>
      <li>It is easily adaptable to the ever changing needs of the project as well as the client.</li>
      <li>It is best suited for agile organisations.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>More resources may be required.</li>
      <li>Although cost of change is lesser, but it is not very suitable for changing requirements.</li>
      <li>More management attention is required.</li>
  </ul>

<button class="accordion">Prototyping</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Prototype-based programming is a style of object-based programming where behavior is reused through the process of reusing existing objects that act as prototypes. This model can also be called prototype, prototype-oriented, class-based, or instance-based programming.</p>
  
  <h4>Advantages:</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>This model is flexible in design.</li>
      <li>It is easy to detect errors.</li>
      <li>We can find missing functionality easily.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>This model is costly.</li>
      <li>It has poor documentation because of continuously changing customer requirements.</li>
      <li>There may be too much variation in requirements.</li>
  </ul>

</div>
<button class="accordion">Spiral</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The spiral model is a risk-based software development process model. Based on the unique risk patterns of a given project, the spiral model directs the team to adopt elements of one or more process models, such as an incremental, waterfall, or evolutionary prototype.</p>
  
  <h4>Advantages:</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Software is produced early in the software life cycle.</li>
      <li>Risk handling is one of important advantages of the Spiral model, it is best development model to follow due to the risk analysis and risk handling at every phase.</li>
      <li>Flexibility in requirements. In this model, we can easily change requirements at later phases and can be incorporated accurately. Also, additional Functionality can be added at a later date.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>It is not suitable for small projects as it is expensive.</li>
      <li>It is much more complex than other SDLC models. Process is complex.</li>
      <li>Too much dependable on Risk Analysis and requires highly specific expertise.</li>
  </ul>

</div>
<button class="accordion">V-shape</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>In software development, the V-model refers to a development process that can be considered an extension of the Kose model, and is an example of a more general V-model. Instead of moving linearly downwards, the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase to form a typical V-shape.</p>
  
  <h4>Advantages:</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Simple and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Testing activities like planning, test designing happens well before coding. This saves a lot of time. Hence higher chance of success over the waterfall model.</li>
      <li>Proactive defect tracking – that is defects are found at early stage.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Very rigid and least flexible.</li>
      <li>Software is developed during the implementation phase, so no early prototypes of the software are produced.</li>
      <li>If any changes happen in midway, then the test documents along with requirement documents has to be updated.</li>
  </ul>

<button class="accordion">Agile</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Field development is rapid software development that uses agile methodologies. According to this, project failure is considered to be the most costly aspect of software development, and therefore this type of software development aims to organize the work in a way that would increase the likelihood of success. Every interation involves cross functional teams.</p>
  
  <h4>Advantages of Agile model: </h4>
  <ul>
	<li>Customer satisfaction by rapid, continuous delivery of useful software.</li>
	<li>People and interactions are emphasized rather than process and tools. Customers, developers and testers constantly interact with each other.</li>
	<li>Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months).</li>
	<li>Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication.</li>
	<li>Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.</li>
	<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.</li>
	<li>Regular adaptation to changing circumstances.</li>
	<li>Even late changes in requirements are welcomed</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h4>Disadvantages of Agile model: </h4>
  <ul>
	<li>In case of some software deliverables, especially the large ones, it is difficult to assess the effort required at the beginning of the software development life cycle.</li>
	<li>There is lack of emphasis on necessary designing and documentation.</li>
	<li>The project can easily get taken off track if the customer representative is not clear what final outcome that they want.</li>
	<li>Only senior programmers are capable of taking the kind of decisions required during the development process. Hence it has no place for newbie programmers, unless combined with experienced resources.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h4>Agile software development values</h4>
  <p>Based on their combined experience of developing software and helping others do that, the seventeen signatories to the manifesto proclaimed that they value:</p>
  <ul>
	<li><b>Individuals and interactions</b> over processes and tools - <i>Люди и взаимодействия важнее процессов и инструментов</i></li>
	<li><b>Working software</b> over comprehensive documentation - <i>Работающее программное обеспечение над исчерпывающей документацией</i></li>
	<li><b>Customer collaboration</b> over contract negotiation - <i>Сотрудничество с клиентами в ходе переговоров по контракту</i></li>
	<li><b>Responding to change</b> over following a plan - <i>Реагирование на изменение вместо следования плану</i></li>
  </ul>

<button class="accordion" style="border-top: solid 2px; background-color: #E0E0E0; font-size: 18px;">Challenger Space Shuttle</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The most tragic failures are those that result in a loss of life. On January 28 1986, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: blue;">Challenger Space Shuttle exploded just 76 seconds</a> after take off. It was later determined that a faulty seal on one of the solid rocket boosters combined with the cold weather conditions allowed the tragedy to unfold. Human error was also partly to blame, as experts had warned that the weather conditions would make the launch more risky.
    <br><br> The disaster was caused by the failure of the two redundant O-ring seals in a joint in the Space Shuttle's right solid rocket booster (SRB). The record-low temperatures of the launch reduced the elasticity of the rubber O-rings, reducing their ability to seal the joints.

    Human error can impact any project, big or small, but the role of project management is to put systems in place to minimise the risk of human error derailing a project.</p><br>
    <p><i>In my opinion, to solve this problem, managers should check shuttle status more correctly, spend more time on tests.</i></p>

  <h3>Scrum values:</h3> 
  <ul>
    <li>Commitment - обязательство</li>
    <li>Courage - смелость</li>
    <li>Focus - фокус</li>
    <li>Openness - открытость</li>
    <li>Respect - уважение</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h2>The ONLY Scrum roles:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Product Owner - владелец продукта</li>
    <li>Development Team - команда разработки</li>
    <li>Scrum Master - скрам мастер</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Burntdown chart - график</li>
  </ul>  
  <br>
  <b>Acceptance criteria -</b>критерий по которому определяют насколько что таск сделан: details that indicate the scope of a user story and help the team and product owner determine done-ness.
  <br><br>
  <b>Agile - </b>гибкий: the name coined for the wider set of ideas that scrum falls within; the agile values and principles are captured in the Agile Manifesto.
  <br><br>
  <b>Done - </b>сделано: also referred to as "done done", this term is used to describe a product increment that is considered potentially releasable; it means that all design, coding, testing, and documentation have been completed and the increment is fully integrated into the system.
  <br><br>
  <b>Epic - </b>эпик: a very large user story that is eventually broken down into smaller stories; epics are often used as placeholders for new ideas that have not been thought out fully. There's nothing wrong with having an epic, as long as it is not high priority.
  <br><br>
  <b>Impediment - </b>"проблемы" мешающие гибкой команде: anything that prevents the team from meeting their potential (e.g. chairs are uncomfortable). If organizational, it is the scrum master's responsibility to eliminate it. If it is internal to the team, then they themselves should do away with it.
  <br><br>
  <b>Impediment backlog - </b>бэклог "проблем": a visible or non-visible list of impediments in a priority order according to how seriously they are blocking the team from productivity.
  <br><br>
  <b>Release - </b>выпуск: the transition of an increment of potentially shippable product from the development team into routine use by customers. Releases typically happen when one or more sprints has resulted in the product having enough value to outweigh the cost to deploy it.
  <br><br>
  <b>Spike - </b>"всплеск": a short, time-boxed piece of research, usually technical, on a single story that is intended to provide just enough information that the team can estimate the size of the story.
  <br><br>
  <b>Story point - </b>количество "чего либо", которое обозначает сложность задачи(таска): a unit of measurement applied to the size of a story, cf. Fibonacci sequence T-shirt sizes, powers of 2, are other ways of assigning story points.
  <br><br>
  <b>Velocity - </b>насколько быстро команда выполняет работу(обычно в сторипойнтах(смотри выше)): the rate at which a team completes work, usually measured in story points. In scrum, velocity is how much product backlog effort a team can handle in one sprint. This can be estimated by viewing previous sprints, assuming the team composition and sprint duration are kept constant. It can also be established on a sprint-by-sprint basis, using commitment-based planning.
  <br><br>
  <b>XP practices - </b>практики из экстремального программирования: the set of development practices, including pair-programming, test-first, or test-driven development (TDD) and continuous refactoring, which are drawn from the XP methodology; many scrum teams find these practices greatly improve productivity and team morale.
  <br><br>
  <b>Impirical process - </b>эмпирический процесс, процесс познания, в котором получение знания не отделено от общественно практической деятельности людей.
  <br><br>
  <b>Removing impediments - </b> убрать препядствие.
  <br><br>
  <b>Planning Sprint - </b> Планирование Спринта
